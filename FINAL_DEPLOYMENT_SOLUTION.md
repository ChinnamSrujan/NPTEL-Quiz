# ✅ FINAL DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

The `index.html` path issue has been resolved by deploying frontend and backend separately!

**Your app is now ready to deploy! 🚀**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Problem**
```
Could not find a required file.
Name: index.html
Searched in: /opt/render/project/src/frontend/public
```

### **Root Cause**
- Render's static site builder doesn't handle `dir` property correctly for monorepos
- Render was looking in wrong directory path

### **Solution**
✅ Deploy backend with render.yaml (works fine)
✅ Deploy frontend as separate static site (without render.yaml)
✅ Both services communicate via API
✅ No path confusion
