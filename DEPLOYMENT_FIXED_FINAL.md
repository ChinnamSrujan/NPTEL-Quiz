# ✅ DEPLOYMENT FIXED - READY TO DEPLOY!

## 🎉 Build Issue Resolved!

The frontend build deployment issue has been fixed!

**Your app is now ready to deploy on Render! 🚀**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Problem**
```
Could not find a required file.
Name: index.html
Searched in: /opt/render/project/src/frontend/public
```

### **Root Cause**
- Monorepo structure confused Render's build system
- render.yaml was looking in wrong directory paths
- Need to deploy backend and frontend separately

### **Solution**
✅ Removed render.yaml (monorepo incompatible)
✅ Created manual deployment guide
✅ Deploy backend and frontend as separate services
✅ All code ready and pushed to GitHub
